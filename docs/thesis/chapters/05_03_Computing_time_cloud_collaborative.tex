Test results for real agents were performed for agent devices forced to use half of their CPU and 512M of memory. Algorithms were grouped into non-collaborative group(A*, Cloud A*) and collaborative group(CA*, Cloud CA*), results can be seen on figures \ref{fig:on_prem_test_time} and in logarithmic scale on figure \ref{fig:on_prem_test_time_log}. Vertical axis represents sum of paths computing time in milliseconds and vertical axis indicates dimension of map i.ex map with dimension 5 will have 25(5x5) possible location for the agent.

Findings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Non-collaborative algorithms are significantly faster than collaborative ones as they have lower time complexity. 
    \item Average time difference between A* and Cloud A* is around 150ms.
    \item Cloud A* has higher deviation of the results than A*.
    \item CA* beats Cloud A* on the smallest map, on any other map Cloud CA* is performing better.
    \item Cloud CA* is around 10x faster on average than CA*.
\end{itemize}
