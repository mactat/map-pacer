\chapter{Testing and Analyses}
System mentioned in this work is complex and manual testing is not viable approach, therefore automatic testing was implemented. For this purpose additional micro-service was introduced, called performance-test. It utilize backend REST api to create reproducible test cases. It is also gathering the results and shows performance kpis for the system. Example of test maps can be seen in appendix \ref{sec:app_04}.
