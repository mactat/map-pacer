\chapter{Testing and Analysis}
The system mentioned in this work is complex and manual testing is not a viable approach, therefore automatic testing was implemented. For this purpose, an additional microservice was introduced, called a performance test. It utilizes backend REST API to create reproducible test cases. It is also gathering the results and shows performance KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for the system. An example of test maps can be seen in Appendix \ref{sec:app_04}.
