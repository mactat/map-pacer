\chapter{Introduction}
Path planning is a common task in the current industry setup for autonomous navigation, while more mobile robots are being used it becomes important to solve this task efficiently using different approaches. As path planning is computationally intensive in a large setup, it might require more resources than a single agent can provide, therefore this project will explore collaborative computing between the agent as well as edge-cloud collaborative computing.
