\chapter{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Communication time around 150 ms
    \item Usually one round trip is enough to perform computation
    \item if algorithm takes more than computing time it is worth to perform it in the cloud
    \item A* is robust and needs low resources therefore it might make sense to perform it locally for smaller maps
    \item CA* is better to be performed in the cloud (if map is not very small < 5)
    \item CA* is more than 10x faster when performing in cloud
    \item communication time doesn't matter because computation time is high
    \item if the agent's resources are lower than 1 CPU and 800 MB of memory it is always better to perform CA* in the cloud as it results in more paths being found.
    \item In case of very low resource profile(details) it is better even for A* to be performed in the cloud, especially for larger maps
    \item Agent with high resources can compete with cloud agent
    \item Cloud agent can scale easily so it can support multiple on-prem agents
