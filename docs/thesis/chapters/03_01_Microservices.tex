In recent years wide cloud adoption has caused huge momentum in adopting software architecture known as micro-services, as it is a native architecture for the cloud. This project will also adapt this architecture because part of the deployment is being done in the cloud, and a swarm of agents can also be simulated using this approach. Moreover, technologies such as kind and tilt made it easier to develop all services locally using the local Kubernetes cluster.

Microservices are small autonomous services that cooperate with each other to create certain application logic \cite{building_microservices}. Usually, microservices are deployed as Linux containers and encapsulate logic for a single logical part of the solution. Those services are then communicating whit each other to build bigger, more complex systems.

\subsection{Agent}
An agent microservice is a small, independent microservice that is responsible for implementing the logic of an entity that needs to plan a path. When the agent microservice is started, it begins a process called local discovery to find other instances of the same microservice, which are referred to as its peers. Once its peers are discovered, the agent microservice initiates an election algorithm to determine which agent will be the leader of the group, or "swarm." The leader is responsible for coordinating the actions of the other agents and ensuring that they are working together effectively.

In addition to its responsibilities as a member of a swarm, the agent microservice also performs periodic liveness checks on its peers to verify that they are still active and able to communicate. This is important because it ensures that the swarm remains functional even if one or more agents become unavailable or unresponsive.

The agent  also contains algorithms for path planning, and in a base-case scenario, it is responsible for performing the computations necessary to determine the optimal path, but it can also outsource the computation to the cloud by sending messages to the cloud agent. It communicates with other microservices using a local broker, the number of instances of the  microservice may vary depending on the needs of the system, and it is designed to have limited resources to simulate a real-world scenario. 

\subsection{Cloud-agent}
The cloud-agent is a service that provides computational resources to offload the workload from agents. It is designed to have significantly more computing power than the agents, but it may be located in a different geographical location, which could result in latency issues when transmitting data back and forth.

In order to communicate with the agents, the cloud-agent uses the cloud-broker as a medium. The cloud-broker acts as an intermediary, enabling the cloud-agent and the agents to exchange messages and data.

The cloud-agent is deployed in the cloud and is intended to be used for performing computationally intensive tasks that would be too resource-intensive for the agents to handle on their own. By offloading these tasks to the cloud-agent, the agents may be able to operate more efficiently.

\subsection{Broker}
This service plays a crucial role in the system, it is responsible for facilitating communication between various services. It is deployed both in the cloud and in local environments, and the two entities are connected by a bridge. The bridge serves as a single connection point between the cloud and the edge, allowing the two to communicate and exchange data.

Alternatively, the cloud and local services can also cross-subscribe to both brokers, allowing them to communicate directly with each other. The service uses a publish-subscribe approach to handle and distribute messages between the different services.

The service acts as an intermediary, enabling services to exchange messages and data without the need for direct communication. This can help to reduce the complexity of the overall system and make it more scalable and resilient.

\subsection{Map-service}
This service is responsible for generating maps and spawning agents within them. When an agent is first created, it does not have any map assigned to it. The leader agent will trigger the generation of a new map by sending a message to the map-service. The map-service is responsible for creating the map and spawning the agent within it. Communication between the map-service and the agents is facilitated by the broker service. The broker service acts as an intermediary, enabling the map-service and the agents to exchange messages and data. It is through the broker service that the map-service sends the necessary information to the agents and receives requests and updates from them.

The map-service serves as a substitute for sensing for the agent, as it provides the robot with all the necessary information for determining its position on a global map. In addition to generating new maps, the map-service also stores pre-defined maps that can be adopted by the agent upon request.

It is possible for the map-service to spawn agents in places that are not reachable from the goal. This is a valid scenario as not all points on the map might be reachable. The map-service is a crucial component for enabling agents to navigate and interact with their environment.

\subsection{Backend}
This service is designed to gather data and facilitate communication with a core module service (such as an agent or map service) through a cloud broker. The service exposes endpoints through a REST API (Appendix \ref{app:app_01}), which can be accessed by a frontend application. It also forwards requests to an MQTT broker.

In addition to interacting with other services, this service also receives data from various entities and stores it in a database. The backend of this service is deployed in the cloud, and the endpoints are accessible to end-users. It is equipped with a database for storing data. The database is attached to the service, which means that it is directly accessible and can be used for storing and retrieving data as needed. The service is designed to receive data from various entities, and it stores this data in the attached database for later use.

This service acts as an intermediary between the frontend, the core module service, and the MQTT broker, allowing them to communicate and exchange data. It is deployed in the cloud and connected to a cloud broker, which enables it to access resources and services hosted in the cloud.

\subsection{Frontend}
The frontend of this service is a graphical interface that is deployed as a web service. It is accessed by end users through a web browser and is used to trigger specific actions and perform raw data visualization.

The frontend is responsible for taking input from the end user and sending requests to the backend service through its API. It is also used for visualizing raw data, allowing the end user to view and analyze the data in various ways.

The frontend is deployed in the cloud and is exposed to end users over the internet. Its capabilities are further explained in the \hyperref[sec:0308]{visualization section} section of the documentation.

Frontend serves as the interface between the end user and the backend service, allowing the end user to interact with the service and access its functionality. It is an important component of the service, as it enables the end user to perform various actions and view raw data in an intuitive and user-friendly way.
