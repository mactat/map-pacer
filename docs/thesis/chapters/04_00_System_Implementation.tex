\chapter{System Implementation}
The following section provides an in-depth examination of the implementation process of the designed system. It outlines the technical details of the local development setup, deployment options, and the implementation of various algorithms used within the system. In addition, it explains the communication protocols employed between different services within the system and the implementation observability of the system. The system is developed using robust coding practices and industry-standard development tools. The project employs a continuous integration and continuous deployment model, in which code changes are automatically deployed to both cloud and on-premises instances following modifications to the source code, as depicted in Appendix \ref{sec:app_07}.
