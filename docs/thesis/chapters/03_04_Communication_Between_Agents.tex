The broker is a component responsible for facilitating communication between micro-services. In an on-prem system, the broker is deployed to allow communication between agents and map service. In an industry setup, it would probably be deployed in a stand-alone server located in the same subnet as the agents. It is a middleman which receives all messages and redirects them to specific parties involved in the communication process. One broker can be used to support multiple systems, as long as they are connected to the same subnet as the broker. It is possible because the messaging scheme is distinctive for every system(\ref{sec:app_02}), so the broker is able to correctly route the request.

MQTT protocol was selected for communication between the agents because it is extremely lightweight and suitable for IoT communication, therefore it can support also agents with very limited resources(memory, CPU, bandwidth).
